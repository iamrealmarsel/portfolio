Hello, world! 👋 I'm Marsel and I'm a front-end developer. 👨‍💻

I studied computer science at university many years ago when the grass was greener and the sky bluer, but I dropped out of it because I didn't like programming, I was more drawn to creative professions. One day, many years after that, I had one problem that I was able to solve only with the help of programming, it was JavaScript, and then I realized the power of programming and fell in love with it. From that moment my ninja journey began. Such is the irony of fate. 😥

## Work experience 👨🏻‍💼

At first it was more like a hobby, but then it turned into a full-time job.

At the moment, I have about half a year experience in front-end development (training projects and freelance) and about a year in HTML-development (commercial projects in a company).

More than 5 training SPA projects 🗂 were developed - 4 of them using React, 3 of them using TypeScript.
And more than 35 commercial static projects 💼 were HTML-developed - about 20 landing pages, about 10 multi-page sites, about 5 letters.

You can see my completed projects, with a description, on the [main page](/#), tags are attached to each project, by which you can filter. Also, for each project there is a link to github repository and a link to the deploy.

## Skills 🦾

During my ninja journey, I've had experience with various front-end "tools". It is difficult to accurately assess the level of knowledge of each of them, so I roughly divided the skills into three levels for your understanding.

### Good knowledge 🥇

HTML, CSS, SCSS, BEM, Tea Drinking 🍵

### Intermediate knowledge 🥈

Javascript, React, React Router, Redux Toolkit, Webpack, Git, Figma, Adobe Photoshop

### Basic knowledge 🥉

TypeScript, OOP, Jest, Canvas, GSAP, React Material UI, Bootstrap, Email coding, Gulp, RESTful API. I also read about Data Structure and Design Patterns and solved several tasks on these topics on codewars.

By the way, I saw a codewars profile badges on many personal sites and github, so I'll put it here too. 💁‍♀️

## Soft skills 🧸

Also, of course, I have soft skills, though I’m not sure which ones. 🤷‍♀️

I guess it’s logic, creativity, perfectionism or pedantry (I haven’t figured it out yet, but I think that they hinder me more than help 🤔), responsibility, eternal student, emoji inserter 🙋‍♀️.

## Goals 🎯

Living without a goal is like being in a fog 🌫, not seeing anything around. It is not clear where to go and what you will come to. The goal gives you a fog diffuser 🔦 in your hands (in fact, no such device exists) and you can already roughly understand where to move. Of course, over time, goals are adjusted or can completely change, since life is an unpredictable thing and everything around is changing.

At the moment my main goals are:

- Level up my skills above
- Add knowledge of Feature-Sliced Design, Nextjs, GraphQL to current skills
- Learn the basic backend - Nodejs, Expressjs, Mongodb
- Learn English, at least to correctly write the text on this page 😀

I chose these goals because I think they will take me to the next level 🚀 in web-development. But since there is still a creative person living in me (in general, there are many people living in me 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦, but few people get along with each other), I would like to add here the learning of WebGL in order to "draw with code" beautiful 3d objects and animate them.

## The End 😭

In this chapter of my short story, I would like to tell you -
"Thank you and see you at the office 👋".
